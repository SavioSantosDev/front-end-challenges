## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- VS Code and Live Server + Others extensions
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Improve English;
- Organize the project with markdown. If you want more help with writing markdown, I'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
- CSS Grid;

I used this chalenge to test a styling technique for responsive fonts by using the `clamp` css function. [clamp() MDN documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

```css
:root {
  --bp-tablet: 768;
  --bp-desktop: 1440;
}

body {
  font-size: clamp(
    calc(1px * var(--font-size-mobile)),
    calc(1vw * calc((var(--font-size-tablet) * 100 / var(--bp-tablet)))),
    calc(1px * var(--font-size-desktop))
  );
}
```

`clamp(MIN, MIDDLE, MAX)` Basically, the **MIN** and **MAX** values will be defined. The **MIDDLE** value will be defined using the `VW CSS Unit` and calculated by: FONT_SIZE \* 100 / BREAKPOINT. FONT_SIZE is the desired value of the font in a BREAKPOINT between mobile and desktop.

This is something that still needs to be refined.
